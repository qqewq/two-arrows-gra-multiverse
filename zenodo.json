  "description": "A theoretical framework unifying the thermodynamic arrow of time and the cosmological negentropic arrow within a multilevel GRA meta-reset architecture of the multiverse. The work introduces operator-valued arrows, a multilevel GRA functional, and a coupled evolution matrix that together define a single law of evolution in the multiverse, allowing both arrows to coexist without violating the Second Law of Thermodynamics.",
